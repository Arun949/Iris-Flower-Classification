# Iris-Flower-Classification
Iris flower classification is a classic machine learning problem that involves categorizing iris flowers into three different species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica) based on their sepal and petal characteristics
Deep learning, specifically using neural networks, can be used to solve this problem. Below is a high-level description of how you can perform iris flower classification using Python and deep learning:

Dataset:

The first step is to acquire the Iris dataset, which is commonly available in libraries like Scikit-learn. It contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for each iris sample along with its corresponding species label.
Data Preprocessing:

Load the dataset and split it into features (sepal and petal measurements) and labels (species).
Encode the categorical species labels into numerical values. For example, you can use one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Data Splitting:

Split the dataset into a training set and a testing set to assess the model's performance.
Model Building:

Create a deep learning model using a framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch. A simple feedforward neural network is often sufficient for this task.
Design the input layer with the appropriate number of neurons (four for sepal and petal measurements).
Add one or more hidden layers with activation functions (e.g., ReLU) and an output layer with three neurons (one for each species).
Define an appropriate loss function (e.g., categorical cross-entropy) and an optimizer (e.g., Adam).
Model Training:

Train the deep learning model using the training data.
Adjust hyperparameters like the number of epochs, batch size, and learning rate to optimize model performance.
Model Evaluation:

Use the testing dataset to evaluate the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
You can also visualize the model's performance with confusion matrices or ROC curves.
Model Deployment:

Once satisfied with the model's performance, you can deploy it in production.
This could be as part of a web application, a REST API, or any other suitable deployment method.
Inference:

You can make predictions on new data using the trained model to classify iris flowers into their respective species.
